Senior Project Code for planner

Abstract: Itâ€™s about you planner solves the problem of finding a planner that suits the needs of an individual using the languages JavaScript and HTML. 
This customizable planner design populates based off a series of questions that analyzes he number of jobs, classes, or organizations one is apart of. 
From there it will populate color coded task list and multiple calendars, budget list, quotes based off of ones needs.

Directions: Start at the home page: https://sthomp18.github.io/stseniorproject/
Select a branch and each component will populate. Each page has a go back button just in case you make the wrong selection.

Note: Original scope of the project was bigger than what was achieved. Therefore, this project will be worked on throughout the spring semester. 
After presenting on Friday, November 20, people who attended my breakout room suggested that they would rather make all of the selections and they pay for the
planner to be mailed to them versus them being printed out. So I plan on changing the software so it will be an order form and created into a business.
